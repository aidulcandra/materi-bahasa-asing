NOTHING WAS IMPOSSIBLE

 
Katie wants a lot of things that are hard to get. She wants to be President of the United States when she is 35. She wants to go to Harvard. She wants to get 1 million friends. She wants to have 10 more siblings. She wants to be a belly dancer. She wants to travel all over the world. She told her mom about all her dreams. "You should be more realistic," her mom said. "But I want to be amazing!" Katie said. "Start small," her mom said. Katie ignored her mom. Nothing was impossible. The word impossible even says, "I'm possible."
