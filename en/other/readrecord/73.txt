Introducing Myself


I am a new student in school. I tell the class about myself. I am from Canada, but now I live in Nevada. I live with my mom, dad, and brother. My brother is five years younger than me. Music is very important to me. I like to sing and dance. I also play the saxophone. One day, I hope to be a music teacher.




Thanks for recording your unique, blessed, and beautiful voice on this one.🗣️🎙️👏🏻🤩
