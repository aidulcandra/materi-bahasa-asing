*Mom Doesn't Like John*

Amanda is dating John. They have been dating for a year. Amanda wants John to meet her parents. John does not want to. He has heard that they are mean. Amanda yells at him. John finally gives in.

They go to Amanda's parents' house. John has presents for them. John gives Amanda's dad chocolates. Then, he gives Amanda's mom flowers. They say thank you. They all eat dinner together. Amanda's mom asks John what he does for a living. John says he is an actor. 

Amanda's mom nods. She does not like that he doesn't have a stable job. She wishes that he was a doctor. She does not approve.
