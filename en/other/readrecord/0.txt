*A Day for Ice Cream*

It is a sunny day. She feels hot. She fans herself with a book. It is still hot. She turns on the air conditioner. It is still hot. She jumps into a pool. It is still hot. 

Her dad has an idea! He takes her to the ice cream shop. They share a banana split. She does not feel hot anymore.
