*Speaking Activities*


Do you like doing speaking activities in class? How often do you do them? I like speaking activities. It’s always fun to speak to different people and practice your English. The teacher usually chooses something fun to talk about. I like role plays. When I do a role play, I can escape from my own personality. I can talk more because it’s like acting. Sometimes I get fed up when I do a speaking activity because my partner doesn’t talk. That’s silly. If you’re doing a speaking activity, you have to speak. I’m not sure why some people don’t get this. I want to know what my teacher thinks when we do speaking activities. She walks around and smiles at us but doesn’t really say anything.
