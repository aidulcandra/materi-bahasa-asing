*Trying New Things*

Shirley is a very picky eater. She does not eat anything with cheese. She does not like chicken or pork. She does not like trying new things. 

One day, Shirley went to her friend's house. Her friend's dad made them a Cambodian dish. Shirley was used to eating American food. "I can't eat this," Shirley said to her friend. "You have to! My dad made it for you," she said. 

Shirley felt bad. She grabbed her fork. She slowly stuck it into the food. She ate it slowly. It was surprisingly good. She finished her food in five minutes. "Wow! I will get you another plate," her friends's dad said.
