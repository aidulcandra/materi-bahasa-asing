*Wholesale Store*

Maya likes to save money. She likes wholesale stores better than markets. Wholesale stores sell things in large quantities for a lower price. They have things like a gallon of mustard. A regular market only sells a bottle of mustard. 

Maya wants to buy apples, ketchup, and chips. The apples come in a pack, which has 20 apples. The pack costs $6. That means each apple is only 30 cents. At the market, each apple costs 40 cents. 

Maya's husband does not like wholesale stores. He gets tired of things easily. He would rather buy fewer apples for a higher price. "Maya, we can't finish 20 apples before they go bad," her husband said. "Of course we can!" Maya said.
