*She Loves Walking*

Veronica is 21 years old. She has not had a driver's license yet. Her friends make fun of her. She does not care. 

She loves walking. She can walk fast. She can walk for hours. She walks to school every day. She walks to work every day. She walks to the market when she needs to. She does not get tired easily. She thinks walking is very relaxing. 

Running is a different story. She does not like to run. Running is tiring. Her stomach hurts when she runs. 

Veronica's new job is far away. She still won't get a car. She plans to take the bus.
