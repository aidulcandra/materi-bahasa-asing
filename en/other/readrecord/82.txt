LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP


Arthur and Betty used to go to the same high school. After high school, they went to different colleges. They still wanted to date though. Arthur lives in California. Betty lives in Massachusetts. They talked to each other a lot. They talked on the phone. They sent letters. They sent photos of what they were doing to each other. They talked to each other on Facetime, too. It was hard though. Arthur and Betty had to deal with the time difference. Massachusetts was three hours ahead of California. Sometimes Arthur forgets to call. He tried to talk to her at 11 p.m. California time. It was 2 a.m. in Massachusetts though. They miss each other a lot.
