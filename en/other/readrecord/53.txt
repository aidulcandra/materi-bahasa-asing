Borrowing Books and Movies

 
Kaylin went to the library. She needed to get books for her project on Barack Obama. She found his biography. It was a heavy book with a lot of information. She flipped through the pages. There were some nice pictures of Obama. The book seemed helpful. She put it in her basket. She found the movie section. She decided to check it out. She could borrow a movie for three days for free. It would cost $3 to borrow a movie for seven days. She picked a movie about a girl with diabetes. She put it in her basket. She checked out the book and the movie.
