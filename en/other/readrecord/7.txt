Quality of life is important to all of us. It’s something we all try to improve. I’m just wondering how easy it is to improve your quality of life. The biggest things that affect how happy you are are your job, house, holidays and friends. Of course there are others. It’s quite difficult to change these things. If you don’t like your job, it can be difficult to find a better one. My job really affects my quality of life. If it’s really stressful, my quality of life goes down. You also need somewhere nice to live. That can be difficult to change. It’s important to find a home that feels like home. Holidays can add a lot to your happiness, but we don’t have lots of those. And then there are friends. They really improve your quality of life.
