It is lunch time. The kids go out to eat. They are excited and hungry. Paul has a ham sandwich. He does not like ham. He wants a tuna sandwich. 

Sarah has a tuna sandwich. She thinks tuna is smelly. She wants a ham sandwich. 

Paul and Sarah meet up. They trade their sandwiches. They get what they want.
