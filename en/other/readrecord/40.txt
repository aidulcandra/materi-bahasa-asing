Vocabulary Activities


I really like doing vocabulary activities. I think they are a great way for us to learn vocabulary. My teacher always gives us vocab activities that are like games. They are great fun and I’m sure that helps us remember the words and phrases. He makes us do the same activity again and again but changes the order of the words. Eventually, I get 100 per cent. When I was at school, I learnt vocab from lists. That was really boring. My new teacher has shown me lots of different activities to remember vocab. He taught us to look for word patterns and focus on the family of a word. He also teaches us a lot of phrases and expressions. I really like vocabulary now, thanks to the fun activities we do in class.
