*The Mysterious Box*

The old wooden box sat in the corner of the room, untouched for years. Nobody knew what was inside it or where it came from. Some people in the town whispered that it might be cursed, but most just shrugged it off as an old relic of times gone by. One day, a curious young boy named Jack decided to investigate the box. He approached it with caution, unsure of what he might find. As he reached out to touch the lid, the box suddenly shook and emitted a loud creaking noise. Jack stumbled backwards in fright and ran out of the room. From that day on, nobody dared to go near the box again.
