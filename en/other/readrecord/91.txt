Weekends


What would life be like without weekends? I live for weekends. I love weekends. When Thursday arrives, I start getting excited. The end of the week is near. The good times are about to begin. The very second I finish work, the weekend starts. I get into weekend mode. I usually have a lot planned. I have to go out on Friday night. Everyone's out and having a good time. Saturday is a good day for doing things. I usually go somewhere interesting. For eight months of the year, it's football season, so there's usually a good match somewhere. Saturday is also the day I go to a nice restaurant. I meet my friends somewhere in town and we go and have a meal. I hate the end of the weekend.
