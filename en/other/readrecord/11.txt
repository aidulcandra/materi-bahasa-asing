*The Corner*

Jill does not like math. Jill starts talking about food. Her friends laugh. They stop doing their homework. The teacher is upset. She tells them to stand in the corner. 

Jill goes to the corner. It is hard to be quiet. She thinks about her family. She thinks about her dog. Five minutes pass. The teacher lets her go.
