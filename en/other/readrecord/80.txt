When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim’s warmth but finding 
only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our 
mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping. 

I prop myself up on one elbow. There’s enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled 
up on her side, cocooned in my mother’s body, their cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks 
younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim’s face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother was very beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me. 

Sitting at Prim’s knees, guarding her, is the world’s ugliest cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of rotting squash. Prim named him 
Buttercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. I t's hates me. Or at least distrusts me. Even though it was years ago, I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly 
swollen with worms, crawling with fleas. The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed. But Prim 
begged so hard, cried even, I had to let him stay. It turned out okay. My mother got rid of the vermin and he’s a born mouser. Even catches the occasional rat.

Sometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the entrails. He has stopped hissing at me. 

Entrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever come to love.
