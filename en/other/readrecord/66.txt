*Walking*

Walking is one of the best forms of exercise you can do. People don't think it is exercise, but it is. If you increase the amount you walk every day, you will be healthier. In fact, it is possible to lose weight through walking, but you have to walk a lot. The best thing to do is think how you can walk instead of driving or taking the escalator. 

I find I walk a lot in my job. I'm sure walking up and down the corridors a hundred times a day helps me stay healthy. You should try to go for a long walk every day. You'll find new areas of your neighbourhood and feel great when you come back. And what about a walking holiday? Instead of sitting on the beach, get up into the mountains and walk all day.
